# PROJECT STATE — freqtrade-strategy-miner

**Project**: freqtrade-strategy-miner — turn the demo starter template into a working, verified,
self-contained Freqtrade strategy-mining pipeline (genome -> compile -> backtest -> score ->
shortlist -> hyperopt -> validation -> bias checks -> walk-forward -> robustness -> final test ->
champion), driven by config + registry, orchestrated around the freqtrade docker image.
**Repo**: `F:/freqtrade-strategy-miner-template` · **Worktrees**: `F:/freqtrade-strategy-miner-worktrees/<TASK-ID>`

## Current milestone
**M1 — walking skeleton foundation** (2026-10-08): runner + results parsing + registry + params
flow + data stage implemented, tested, and merged; existing template modules covered by tests.
Exit criteria: wave-1 tasks verified + merged on main; full suite green on the merged tree.

## Completed
- 2026-10-08 — SCAN: template audited (demo-only; WORKFLOW.md stages 3–10 unimplemented);
  freqtrade-stable mapped (live ops env — READ-ONLY reference); docker image freqtrade 2026.9
  verified (backtesting/hyperopt/lookahead/recursive/download-data present); agent CLIs + guard
  hook + kit preflight green (11/11).
- 2026-10-08 — workspace bootstrapped (control plane seeded); venv `.venv` (uv, Python 3.12.14:
  pytest+ruff+pandas+pyarrow); real backtest fixture -> `tests/fixtures/backtest-sample.zip`;
  runtime freqtrade config `freqtrade/user_data/config.miner.json`; own data download (5m,
  BTC/ETH/SOL, 2022-2026) requested into own user_data (self-contained; live env untouched).
- 2026-10-08 — interfaces v1 FROZEN (.orchestrator/INTERFACES.md).

## In progress
- Wave 1 dispatch: T-101 (runner+results) · T-102 (store+params) · T-103 (data) · T-104 (tests+docs).

## Next up
- Wave 1 verify + merge (Hermes) -> Wave 2 stages (T-201..T-205) -> E2E acceptance (T-301).

## Blocked
- none

## Key decisions (see DECISIONS.md)
- D-003 self-contained runtime (own user_data + own data; freqtrade-stable read-only)
- D-004 no editable install (worktree isolation)
- D-005 hyperopt params via freqtrade native params-file mechanism
- D-006 registry = SQLite `output/miner.db`
- D-007 repo stays PRIVATE (fixture contains proprietary strategy results)
